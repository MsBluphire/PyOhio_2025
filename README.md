When Your SME Ghosts You: Using GenAI to Build a Database Documentation Agent

# 🗂️ Database Documentation Agent (aka SME Ghost Protocol)

Welcome to the official repository for **SME Ghost Protocol**, a GenAI-powered project built to tackle the least glamorous—but most essential—task in data work: documenting legacy databases no one wants to touch.

🪄 Presented at **PyOhio 2025** by Denise Williams

## 💡 Project Overview

When the Subject Matter Expert (SME) leaves, their tribal knowledge often leaves with them. This project explores how we can use **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to capture and preserve that knowledge—automatically.

This repo includes:

- 🧠 A **Kaggle notebook** showcasing the MVP of the Database Documentation Agent
- 🎤 A **slide deck** used during the PyOhio 2025 talk
